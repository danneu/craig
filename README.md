I pushed up a big ball of code that had been sitting on my laptop for a year: [here's the commit](https://github.com/danneu/craig/commit/ffc6e12645dc4d19cd62c07a63f7f8690162445b).

It fixes some critical errors but I haven't yet updated the gem release.

# Craig

A Craigslist listings scraper.

* Inspired by [gregstallings/craigslist](https://github.com/gregstallings/craigslist).
* A just-for-fun self-educational exercise.

## Installation

    $ gem install craig

## Usage

~~~ ruby
require "craig"
~~~

Pass in the city and category:

~~~ ruby
listings = Craig.query(:austin, :for_sale)
~~~

Or narrow down your results with a subcategory:
 
~~~ ruby
listings = Craig.query(:austin, :for_sale => :computers)
~~~

Returns up to 100 `Listing`s.

## Examples

Let's check out some cars within our budget.
    
~~~ ruby
vehicles = Craig.query(:austin, :for_sale => :cars_trucks)
vehicles.select { |v| 
  v.price.between?(6000, 8000) && 
  v.image? &&
  v.seller == :owner 
}

#=> [<Listing>, <Listing>, <Listing>]
~~~
    
I'm about to move to Birmingham. I wonder where the kids my age are living.
    
~~~ ruby
listings = Craig.query(:birmingham, :personals => :strictly_platonic)
listings.select { |p| 
  p.age < 30
}.map(&:location)

#= ["Highland Ave", "Highland Ave", "Highland Ave"]
~~~

Oh wait, I left my trombone downtown last night. I wonder if anyone found it.
    
~~~ ruby
listings = Craig.query(:austin, :community => :lost_found
listings.any? { |listing| listing.title =~ /trombone/i }

#=> true
~~~

Let's get the price of the most expensive Macbook that's sold by an owner 
(instead of a dealer) on or near UT campus.

~~~ ruby
Craig.query(:austin, :for_sale => :computer)
  .select { |c| 
    c.seller == :owner && 
    c.location[/campus/i] &&
    c.title[/macbook/i]
  }.sort_by { |c| 
    -c.price 
  }.first

# Output

#=> {
  :url => "http://austin.craigslist.org/sys/3723418912.html"
  :title => "Late 2011 Macbook Pro"
  :seller => :owner
  :price => 1050
  :posted_at => #<Date: 2013-01-23 ((2456316j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
  :location => "West campus"
  :has_map? => false
  :has_image? => true
  :id => 3723418912
}
~~~

## Available Listing methods

The easiest way to see what listings respond to is to just send them `Listing#to_hash`:

~~~ ruby
Craig.query(:new_york_city, :jobs).map(&:to_hash)
~~~

Or just look at console output (`Listing#to_s` outputs the hash in string form):

~~~ ruby
Craig.query(:new_york_city, :jobs)
~~~

Or you can look in `listing.rb` to see the type of nodes that Listings have, then find the method each node defines in `node.rb`.

Since I rarely use Ruby Modules, this gem started out as an self-educational scraper concept where Nodes are composed of Nodes are composed of Nodes but I didn't get very far. So now the internal API is a little spread out. TODO...

## Available cities and categories

The Craigslist website itself serves as documentation for this
gem's API.

* Cities: http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites/
* Categories: http://austin.craigslist.org/

Just downcase Craigslist's name for it and replace spaces and punctuation with underscores.

Here, let me translate some for you to be clear:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Cities</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>How it appears on Craigslist</th><th>The symbol you pass into Craig</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>beaumont / port arthur</td>
    <td>:beaumont_port_arthur</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cambridge, UK</td>
    <td>:cambridge_uk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>nice / cote d'azur</td>
    <td>:nice_cote_d_azur</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Categories/Subcategories</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>How it appears on Craigslist</th><th>The symbol you pass into Craig</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>for sale</td>
    <td>:for_sale</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cds/dvd/vhs </td>
    <td>:cds_dvd_vhs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>accounting+finance </td>
    <td>:accounting_finance</td>
  </tr>
</table>

~~~ ruby
Craig.query(:nice_cote_d_azur, :for_sale => :cds_dvd_vhs)
~~~

If you're still unsure, just check out Craig's internal lookup table.

## Diverges from Craigslist homepage

While I've mostly modeled Craig's API after Craigslist's website, I've 
diverged from the homepage where I felt it made sense. 

For example, I prefer the "Show All" view where possible.

    :community => :events goes to /eee instead of /eve.

    This way you see all events instead of just events with 
    date ranges.

    :for_sale => :cars_trucks goes to the owners+dealers listings

    instead of the splash page that lets you choose
    TODO: Add search API or expose API to specify this stuff.
